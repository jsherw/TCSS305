# TCSS305
For our final project in TCSS305(Programming Practicum) we were tasked with creating a calcuator that:
1. Utilizes a basic GUI using the swing framework
2. Accepts either Integer or Floating Point inputs
3. Is able to perform the following functions:
      -Addition
      -Subtraction
      -Multiplication
      -Division
          (Truncating integers)
      -Recipricals
      -Square Roots
          (For integers: Should only report if the square root is an integer)
      -Raise to the second power
      -Clear (Clear all inputs)
      -Delete (Delete last input)
 4. Utilizes JUnit testing, with a test coverage of 70% or greater
 5. Logs all user inputs to the console, reporting them when calculation is finished.
 
Originally, this project was meant to be a combination of two previous calculator projects, however due to time constraints those projects were not assigned. Thus, this project is made with the assumption that the user will manually select to either use a floating point calculator or an integer calculator prior to starting any calculations.
